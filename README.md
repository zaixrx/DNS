# Context
now I have implemented a really basic stub resolvers that works on optimal conditions under my supposition(yes it's a word) writing unit tests and maybe even benchmarks is a clear next step that'll come(insha'allah) after making the next thing which is trivially a DNS server! maybe even mDNS idk(which was the hole purpose of the project anyway)

# Dependencies
cJSON it's also dynamically linked soo that's a little bit fucked up I'll work on the structure though
